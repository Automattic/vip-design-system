# VIP Design System

Design system components used throughout VIP.

## Development

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) installed. Here's a [handy installer](https://nodejs.org/download/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Install

To get setup run the following command in the `vip-design-system` directory:

```
npm install 
```

### Watching for changes

You build it continuously so that every time you make a change, build files are automatically updated:

```
npm run watch
```

This is very useful when used together with [npm link ](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link) so that, when you are working on another project that depends on this design system, you can make changes here and changes will be immediately availabe there.
